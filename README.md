# DeepClustering
This is python implementation of **K-means clustering** algorithm for random datasets using transfer learning **VGG-16**

Initial weights loaded from already trained VGG_16 architecture based on IMAGENET datasets give more accuracy than single K-means, hence, k-means with VGG16 produces more robust result
